# Help shelter pets find a home.
This is the starter/proof of concept repo for #BMGHack's petbot. It will probably be folded into a different repository ultimately.
## To run it:
* Use Python 3
* Install the modules in the requirements.txt file (virtualenvs are good here):
`pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`
* You also need a 'config.py' file containing all your API secrets & keys

## Coming soon:
Docker file to make this super easy
